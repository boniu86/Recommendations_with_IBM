Analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles you think they will like.

Though the above dashboard is just showing the newest articles, you could imagine having a recommendation board available here that shows the articles that are most pertinent to a specific user.

In order to determine which articles to show to each user, this notebook performed a study of the data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform. 



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

*__Reccomendation_with_IBM.ipynb__* : Jupyter notebook containing all the codes and results

*__Reccomendation_with_IBM.html__* : notebbok in html format

*__data.csv__* : 2 datasets I used in the notebook



## Insights<a name="insights"></a>

I built a reccomendation engine as instructed, but there are some improvements can be made too. Details is in the notebook.
